# PythonSQLiteFlaskDemo

This repository is meant to be an example to show people how to integrate a database language with Python (specifically with SQLite). 

### Things you probably need:
 - **Python** - You need this to run Python. The link is [here](https://www.python.org).
 - **PIP** - This is the python package manager. This comes along with the Python installation.

### Some nice to haves:
People like using different things to get their local environment set up. Here is some of the stuff we use:
 - **Atom** - This is a lightweight program/text editor with a ton of nice plugins. It was developed by the fine folks here at GitHub. ([Download](https://atom.io/)).
    - **Atom Packages that are nice to have:**
       - **[atom-runner](https://github.com/lsegal/atom-runner)** - Allows you to run python scripts from within Atom.
       - **[atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)** - Allows you to easily make your python code look real pretty.
 - **Scoop** - This is a windows utility that acts like Homebrew. It is a command line installer and  application package manager/repository. You can use it to really easily install python for windows. ([Download](http://scoop.sh/))
 - **Cmder** - This is a really nice windows terminal. Please don't use native Windows cmd. Every time you do, a puppy dies. ([Download](http://cmder.net/))
